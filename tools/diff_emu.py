"""Differential-emulation harness, original side (spec 2026-09-30-reverse-completion-design §5).

Runs the ORIGINAL x86 bytes of one function from a flat image snapshot and reports what it did
(final registers, every byte it changed, which instructions it executed). The port side
(port/tests/diff_runner.c) runs the C function from the same snapshot; tools/diff_verify.py
compares the two. Narrow claim, repeated in every record: equivalence on the exercised blocks
and inputs only.

Flat model, confirmed in E1 (record §E.1): PRAGE.EXE is flat 32-bit, operands are plain linear
addresses (rng_next 0x5D7DC reads `mov eax,[0xef6d8]`), so the emulator maps a 64 MB flat space
with the image at its own addresses and no segment base.
